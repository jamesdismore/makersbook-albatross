 (E'I am the king of the savannah, and nothing stirs my spirit like the chase. From the moment I catch sight of my prey, a surge of power pulses through my muscles — sharp, focused, alive.', 14, '2025-06-04 15:00:00'),
 (E'Hello from the treetops! I’m Raven, architect of the wild, and I’d like to share the story of how I build my nest — a sturdy sanctuary high above the world below.', 13, '2025-06-06 14:00:00'),
